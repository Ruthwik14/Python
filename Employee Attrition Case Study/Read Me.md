# Employee Attrition Case Study

## Section 01: Business Objective Understanding and High-level Approach

### Overall Business Objective:
The objective is to investigate and understand the factors that lead to employee attrition in the company. By analyzing the data, the goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help in reducing attrition and improving employee retention.

### Understanding of the Problem:
The business analyst will align their understanding of the clientâ€™s requirements with the problem of employee attrition. This ensures that the analysis is focused on addressing the specific needs of the client.

### Approach:
The business analyst will follow a well-defined plan to address the problem. The high-level approach may include data health review, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and KPI/metric-based questions to generate insights and provide actionable recommendations.

## Section 02: Data Health Review

### Results Summary:
- **Data Format:** All variables are in the correct format.
- **Missing Values:** Identified missing values in 'NumCompaniesWorked' and 'TotalWorkingYears' columns.
- **Outliers:** Detected outliers in various numerical variables.
- **Data Cleaning:** No significant cleaning required, except for handling missing values.

## Section 03: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Observations:
- **Univariate Distributions:** Analyzed distributions of both object and numeric variables.
- **Bi-variate Distributions:** Examined relationships between relevant numeric variables and cross-tabulations for categorical variables.

## Section 04: KPI/ Metric based questions

### Findings:
1. Attrition rate varies with Salary and other numeric variables. 
2. Attrition rate for different object variables was examined.
3. High Attrition segments were identified based on combinations of various factors.

## Section 05: Open-ended questions and recommendations
