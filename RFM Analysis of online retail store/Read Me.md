# RFM Analysis of Online Retail Data

## Introduction
RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary) Analysis is a method used for analyzing customer value, commonly applied in database marketing and direct marketing. This project aims to perform RFM analysis on online retail data to understand customer behavior and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.

## Data
The data used in this project is from an online retail dataset containing information about invoices, stock codes, descriptions, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and countries. The dataset contains over a million entries.

## Data Preparation
- Imported necessary packages such as pandas and numpy.
- Loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Cleaned the data by converting the 'Price' column to float and removing unnecessary characters.
- Changed the data types of columns like 'InvoiceDate' and 'Customer ID'.
- Renamed the 'Customer ID' column for future operations.
- Created a new column for total revenue as 'Tot_Rev'.
- Removed NaN values and irrelevant customer IDs.
- Created an empty DataFrame for RFM analysis.

## RFM Analysis
- Calculated the frequency of purchases made by each customer.
- Calculated the total revenue generated by each customer.
- Calculated the average revenue per purchase for each customer.
- Sorted the data by customer ID.
- Calculated the recency of each purchase and its duration since the last purchase.
- Created 10 different buckets for the duration (Deciles).
- Calculated the cumulative revenue and percentage cumulative revenue across the deciles.

## Results
The RFM analysis provides insights into customer behavior, such as how recently they made a purchase, how frequently they make purchases, and how much monetary value they contribute. By segmenting customers based on these metrics, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.

## Conclusion
RFM analysis helps businesses identify their most valuable customers, understand their purchasing habits, and target them with personalized marketing campaigns. By leveraging the insights gained from RFM analysis, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction, retention, and overall profitability.
